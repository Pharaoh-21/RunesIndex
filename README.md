# Pharaoh-21 Index ð“‹—

## 1. Introduction

The **Pharaoh-21 Index** is an innovative and automated index designed to identify and track the **21 most important runes** in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Inspired by the grandeur and legacy of the ancient Egyptian pharaohs, this index combines blockchain technology, real-time data, and historical symbolism to provide a reliable and transparent metric for evaluating the value, adoption, and activity of runes.

### The Power of the Pharaoh: Automation and Objectivity
In ancient Egypt, the pharaoh was a divine leader whose decisions were guided by higher principles. In the **Pharaoh-21 Index**, the "power of the pharaoh" translates into a **100% automated system** that selects and weights runes objectively, without human intervention. Runes are not chosen by people but by algorithms analyzing real-time data, ensuring fairness and transparency.

### The Legacy of Egyptian Crowns

In the BRC-20 protocol of Bitcoin, it is possible to inscribe 4-byte symbols, including Egyptian hieroglyphs. The **Pharaoh -21 Index** is the **proud and exclusive owner of all inscribed Egyptian crowns**, a collection of unique and historically significant symbols that now live on the Bitcoin blockchain. These crowns are not just digital assets; they are a bridge between ancient history and modern technology.

The Egyptian crownsâ€”such as the **ð“‹‘ Hedjet** (White Crown of Upper Egypt) and the **ð“‹” Deshret** (Red Crown of Lower Egypt) are more than mere symbols. They represent **power, authority, and unity**, values that are deeply embedded in the **Pharaoh -21 Index**. By owning these crowns, the index not only pays homage to the cultural richness of ancient Egypt but also establishes itself as a **guardian of history and a pioneer in the Bitcoin ecosystem**.

This unique ownership reinforces the **authority and exclusivity** of the **Pharaoh-21 Index**, setting it apart as a project that combines **historical legacy** with **cutting-edge blockchain technology**. The crowns are a testament to the strength and resilience of Bitcoin, just as they were symbols of strength and resilience in ancient times.

### A Project with a Vision for the Future
The **Pharaoh-21 Index** is not just a technical tool; it is a **tribute to history and culture**, represented by the Egyptian crowns inscribed on Bitcoin. And, like the pharaoh, its power lies in objectivity and automation. This project aspires to become a reliable standard for investors, developers, and enthusiasts in the rune ecosystem


## 2.Methodology

The Pharaoh-21 Index uses a fully automated and data-driven approach to select and weight the 21 most important runes in the Bitcoin ecosystem. The methodology is designed to ensure transparency, fairness, and accuracy, eliminating any human bias. Below, we break down the key components of the selection process.

### 2.1. Data Collection

The index relies on real-time data to evaluate runes based on market capitalization, number of holders, and transaction volume. Currently, the primary data source is the Unisat API, a reliable provider of Bitcoin rune data. However, we acknowledge that Unisat is not the most liquid platform, and we are actively working to integrate the Geniidata API soon to enhance data accuracy and coverage.
